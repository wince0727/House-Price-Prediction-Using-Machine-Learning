# Machine Learning – House Price Prediction

# Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning regression model to predict house prices using historical housing data. The task demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow including data loading, feature selection, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

# Objectives

Load and preprocess a housing dataset

Select relevant features and target variable

Split data into training and testing sets

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

# Tools & Technologies
